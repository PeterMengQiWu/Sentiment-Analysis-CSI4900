# Word2Vec and sentiment lexicons in unsupervised sentiment analysis of Reddit Smokers sets

In this study, we applied an embedding algorithm Word2Vec and sentiment lexicons SentiWordNet, MPQA, SocialSent to analyse sentiments in texts with a high volume of objective content.  
The tools have been applied in unsupervised manner, the most realistic scenario in the current sentiment analysis.   Our focus data set is comprised of smoking-related discussions on Reddit; the comparison sets are the i2b2 smoker clinical discharge summaries that have the same topic content with the Reddit data and the Reuters Science news reports, a benchmark data set of texts written in an objective language.  
Our results show that Word2Vec worked better for Reddit texts, where the context decides the sentiment of a word. At the same time, the lexicon-based approach has been more suitable for sentiment analysis of the i2b2 and Reuters data sets.
